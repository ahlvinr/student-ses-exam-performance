## Overview

This project explores how socioeconomic status (SES) predicts academic performance using the *Student Performance Factors* dataset (Nguyen, 2024).  
We analyzed the relationship between Exam Score and multiple SES indicators—including:

- Parental Education Level  
- Family Income  
- Access to Resources  
- Internet Access  

Three regression models were constructed:

1. **Model 1:** Parental Education only  
2. **Model 2:** Multi-Factor SES Model  
3. **Model 3:** Composite SES Index  

Results show that while parental education predicts performance, SES is multidimensional, and including multiple SES factors improves explanatory power. A composite SES index also predicts exam performance effectively, though slightly less precisely than the full multi-factor model.

Interactive visualizations and the complete written report are available on the project webpage linked above.
